# RISC-V implementation verilog

    This is the resord of implemetation of RISC-V in verilog. The project is based on the book "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.

    The project is a single cycle RISC-V implementation. 

    Let's start with the basic components of the RISC-V architecture.

    First let's implement the basic components of the RISC-V architecture. The basic components are:
    1. ALU
    2. Register File
    3. Control Unit
    4. Instruction Memory (syncronous memory)
        Note that in the data_in serves to flash the memory with the instructions.
        and as I'm implementing RV32E which reduces the integer register count to 16 general-purpose registers, (x0â€“x15), where x0 is a dedicated zero register.
    5. Data Memory (syncronous memory)
