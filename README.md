# RISC-V implementation verilog

    This is the resord of implemetation of RISC-V in verilog. The project is based on the book "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.

    The project is a single cycle RISC-V implementation. 

    Let's start with the basic components of the RISC-V architecture.

    First let's implement the basic components of the RISC-V architecture. The basic components are:
    1. ALU
